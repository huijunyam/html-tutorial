HTML
html element => <a>, <p>, <h1> define structure of the content
html tag => <a></a> content of that element
html attribute => provide additional information about an element such as id, class, href in <a> tags

<!DOCTYPE html => inform web browser which version of html we are using
The content in <head> will not be shown in the page
The content in <body> will be shown

Self closing elements => only have one tag and do not have closing tag
example: <br>, <img>, <meta>, <wbr>, <embed>, <input>, <param>, <hr>, <link>, <source>

CSS
linking CSS, we used rel attribute with a value of stylesheet to specify their relationship between html and css
href attr used to identify the location or path of the CSS file

selectors => which elements within our html to target and apply styles to

it is written inside the {} and followed by semicolon
such as background, background-color, font-size, height, width

values => determine what style we like to apply for the property

type selector => target element by their element type
such as <div>, <p>

class selector => allow us to select an element based on the element's class attribute value
